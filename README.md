Larimer Covid data

This will create an interactive dashboard of Larimer County covid data including daily and rolling average
* Vaccinations
* Cases (Positive tests)
* Hospitalizations
* Deaths

With the eventual goal of determining 
* the strongest time-lag correlation between case rate and hospitalizations and death.
* Ratio of cases to hospitalizations and deaths over time.
